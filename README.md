# BabukRansomware
Reversed source code of the Babuk Ransomware Version 1

This was done in under a day, with Chuong Dong's blog being heavily referenced.
I am no professional reverse engineer but I do think I got everything *mostly* accurate,
my own decryptor has been shown to work and decrypt files with this reversed code.
However, I will not be publishing that nor will I publish my ECDH keypair tool.

This was written and tested with Embarcadero Dev-C++,
and the sample which I took apart was:
    - e10713a4a5f635767dcd54d609bed977
